# CampusLoop

> Stay in the loop with events on campus.

Currently to find out about UC events there are a couple ways to do so: uc.edu/inclusion/events which shows a couple events coming up for the next month with a link to a pdf about them, uc mobile app has an event calendar that is not updated with events, and emails are sent out to students about events. All of these ways events are shared from organizers to students is non-interactive, non-intuitive, not easily updateable, and cumbersome. There are so many events going on every week at UC for all kinds of organizations that struggle to reach out to new students, and communicate with previous attendees.

Campus Loop is the solution to this problem. Students can post new events, find out about events in their areas of interest, and stay updated on events they plan to attend. This will give students an all new way to stay active at UC and get the most out of their experience.
